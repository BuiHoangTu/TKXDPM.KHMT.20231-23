\chapter{Supplementary specification}
\textit{{\textless}Presenting other requirements if necessary, including non-functional requirements such as performance, reliability, usability, and supportability; or other technical requirements such as database system, used technology…{\textgreater}}

\section{Functionality}
 {\textless}List of the functional requirements that are general to many use cases. E.g. Among the flow of events of use case, in all the steps that interacts with the database system, if there are errors in the connection or operation processes, there need to be a corresponding error notifications so that the actor knows that the error is related to the database system rather than the user{\textgreater}

\section{Usability}
 {\textless}Requirements that relate to, or affect, the usability of the software. Examples include ease-of-use requirements or training requirements that specify how readily the software can be used by its actors{\textgreater}

\section{Reliability}
 {\textless}Any requirements concerning the reliability of the software. Quantitative measures such as mean time between failure or defects per thousand lines of code should be stated{\textgreater}

\section{Performance}
 {\textless}The performance characteristics of the software. \ Include specific response times. \ Reference related use cases by name{\textgreater}

\section{Maintainability}
 {\textless}Any requirements that will enhance the supportability or maintainability of the software being built{\textgreater}

\section{Design Constraints}
 {\textless}Any design constraints on the software being built{\textgreater}
